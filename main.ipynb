    "# Composite Water Stress Index (CWSI) \n",
    "\n",
    "This project aims to develop a **Composite Water Stress Index (CWSI)** that provides a single, comparable score representing a countryâ€™s water usage, scarcity and sustainability profile. By integrating multiple dimensions such as total consumption, per capita use, groundwater depletion and rainfall. The index offers a multidimensional perspective on how water is being used and conserved globally. "
