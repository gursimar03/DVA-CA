# Composite Water Stress Index (CWSI)

## Overview
The **Composite Water Stress Index (CWSI)** is a multi-dimensional metric designed to assess water stress across countries by integrating various water usage and scarcity indicators into a single comparable score. This project aims to provide insights into global water resource challenges by combining data on consumption, scarcity, agricultural and industrial use, rainfall, and groundwater depletion.

## Features
- Data normalization using Min-Max scaling  
- Dimensionality reduction and feature weighting via Principal Component Analysis (PCA)  
- Weighted sum aggregation to compute the final CWSI score  
- Visualization of water stress trends over time for multiple countries  
- Comparative analysis of CWSI against other water stress indices  

## Data
The dataset includes:
- Total Water Consumption (Billion Cubic Meters)  
- Per Capita Water Use (Liters per Day)  
- Agricultural Water Use (%)  
- Industrial Water Use (%)  
- Household Water Use (%)  
- Rainfall Impact (Annual Precipitation in mm)  
- Groundwater Depletion Rate (%)  
- Time span: 2000-2024  
- Multiple countries
